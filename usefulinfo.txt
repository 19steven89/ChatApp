to get the app started on port 3000 from local host: const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
and use app.listen to start the app on the port number.

also used: app.use(express.static(publicPath));
which lets the app then be run from chrome with the index.html file stored in the publicPath
variable.

Configured the package.json file so the app can be run from heroku using the following
start script:
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server/server.js"

  and then specifying the node version used for thie app:
  "engines": {
    "node": "9.11.2"
  }

used heroku create then git push heroku master
app URL:
https://secure-anchorage-83223.herokuapp.com/
followed by heroku open from the terminal to open the url.
